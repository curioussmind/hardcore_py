list is an object annd like any other object it can be assigned to a variable. 

the items in a list are ordered and each item has an indec indicating its position in the list.

>>> example = [1, 2, 3, 4]
we can access the items using its index
>>> example[0]
 1
>>>example[2]
>>> 3
since  each item in a list is an object, they can be assigned to other variables.
>>> example = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> two = example[2]
>>> print('Second day:', two)
Second day: 3

empty_list = []

list can contain any data type; int, str and even another list. 
>>> krypton = ['Krypton', 'Kr', -157.2, -153.4]
>>> krypton[1]
'Kr'
>>> krypton[2]
-157.2

even though usually  a list is used to contain the same kind of items.
