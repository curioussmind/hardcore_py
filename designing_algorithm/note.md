1. the most effective way to design algorithms is to use top-down design, in which goals are broken down into subgoals until the steps are small enough to be translated directly into a programming language
2. almost all problems have more than one correct solution. choosing between them often involves a trade-off between simplicity and performance
3. the performance of a program can be characterized by how much time and memory it uses. this can be determined experimentally by profiling its execution. one way to prifile time is with function perf_counter from module time.
