OOB involves at least these phases:
1. understanding the problem domain
2. figuring out what type(s) you might want
3. figuring out what features we want our type to have
4. writing a class that represent this type
5. testing our code

# every class in python is derived from class object -> every instance of every class is an object

Example of simplest class
>>> class Book:
        """information about a book""""
